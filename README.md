# [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about)
Done in variety of languages.

I used half of them for the first time (maybe excluding small 'hello-world'ish programs) and for some reason i did not think that later in the month tasks will be harder and so I coded first tasks with languages I am comfortable with - because of that I did harder tasks again using them and did not finished using 25 different languages üòî
